# To Do Checklist

Created a web application to keep track of things to do. The web application was made using Python3, Django, HTML, CSS and SQLite3. I made this project to learn about Django web framework and to use REST APIs.

# Improvements to make

 - Create a login page and use login authentication to verify the user and create unique checklists for each user
 - Migrate database to PostgreSQL
 - Host the application (using Heroku)
